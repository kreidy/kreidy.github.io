I've been involved with the performing arts most of my life, from singing with the San Francisco Boys Chorus at the first inauguration of President Barack Obama to playing trumpet across the country as a member of the UCLA Bruin Marching Band. I graduated from UCLA in 2020 with a major in computer science and minor in theater and am currently working as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon, in the Global Security Operations division.</p>

                            <p>
                                I am a Software Development Engineer at Amazon, under the Global Security Operations division.
                                I work on a team of six engineers who develop, deploy, and maintain our internal software tools
                                Transportation Emergency Systems (TES), Mitigating Violence and Assault by Reviewing Signals (MARS),
                                and Event Management Tool (EMT). TES is used by the Amazon Global Security Operations Center to
                                answer calls from drivers who may have been in a collision or other similar scenarios, and includes
                                tools for recording data about the incident or contacting emergency services. MARS and EMT
                                are used to track further incident details to ensure resolution and determine strategies to prevent
                                future incidents.
                            </p><p>
                                In this role, I've been able to work on both backend and frontend software: most of our frontend code
                                utilizes React and Redux, while our backend is implemented using Node.js servers as well as serverless
                                AWS Lambda functions. I often have opportunities to work alongside UI/UX designers to craft clean, easy-to-use experiences.
                                One such feature, on which I led development, automatically populated the employee data of
                                callers in TES into our incident submission form in EMT, replacing the previous process of manually copying
                                data between the applications. This improvement not only increased accuracy during critical incidents but also saved Amazon
                                approximately $1M annually. In addition to feature development and bug fixing, I enjoy pushing
                                my team to pursue excellent engineering practices; I added automated testing to our deployment
                                pipeline to enable more frequent and more stable deployments, and I am known on my team for making
                                helpful refactors and encouraging cleaner code during code reviews.

                                I worked in C++ and Blueprint code to develop new features and fix bugs for a live game with millions of active players and frequent content updates.
                                I worked closely with the programmers, designers, and artists, both on my team at Heavy Iron and at other studios contributing to the game.
                                I also worked with the QA team to triage bugs and ensure that the player experience was polished.

                            <p>I worked with REMAP on an original show based on Amazon Prime Video's series <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>. The show used AR technology to present stories in parallel timelines simultaneously. As a software developer on the project, I worked on a plugin for the Unreal Engine to receive OSC messages and trigger cues in the game world. I also scripted level sequences and contributed mechanics to improve the realism of 2D video planes in the 3D game engine.</p>
                            <p>I also worked on REMAP's Future Storytelling Summer Institute 2020, in which we developed another original show based on the Argentinian novel <em>La Invención de Morel</em>. In this show, we used the Unreal Engine to present a fully virtual performance, streaming both live and pre-recorded video of our actors into the game world. For this project, I implemented user interface elements for menus, navigation, and identification of actors in the multiplayer server.</p>

                    <p>
                        One of my largest interests outside technology is competitive pinball. I began admiring pinball
                        machines as I saw them around at arcades and arcade bars. I enjoyed playing a few games
                        here or there and began to track my scores to see if I could improve. In late 2021, I saw that
                        an arcade near me was hosting its first tournament since the start of the pandemic, so I decided
                        to give it a shot. I was immediately hooked. I have sinced played in numerous leagues and tournaments
                        from San Diego to Seattle, and my current goal is to qualify for the 2024 California State Finals.

                            I also enjoy running and biking and was on my high school cross country and track teams. A few years ago, 
                            I decided to pursue a bucket-list goal of completing an Ironman Triathlon (the swimming is coming to me).
                            However, there was a period of time in college where even walking became difficult due to a great amount of
                            pain in my lower back and hip. As it turned out, I have an autommune disaease called ankylosing spondylitis,
                            and thanks to the proper diagnosis and treatment, I've become very active again. I completed the Oceanside
                            Ironman 70.3 (Half Ironman) in April 2024 and will run my first marathon in October 2024. I plan to complete
                            a full Ironman in 2027, before my 30th birthday.
